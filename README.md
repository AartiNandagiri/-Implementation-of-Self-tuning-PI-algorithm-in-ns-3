Implementation of Self-Tuning PI algorithm in ns-3

Course Code: CS738

Assignment: # FP5

Overview

Self-tuning PI is an extension of the Proportional Integral controller (PI) algorithm. PI has been implemented in ns-3 (available as a patch). This project aims to extend the existing implementation of PI to support Self-tuning PI.
